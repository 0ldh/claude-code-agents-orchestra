> **Build faster. Ship better. Code smarter.**  
> Turn Claude Code into a coordinated team of 55+ specialized AI agents that work together like a world-class engineering organization.

## 🎯 The Problem: One AI Can't Master Everything

While Claude Code is incredibly powerful, complex projects demand specialized expertise:

- **Backend architects** who understand microservices and API design
- **Security experts** who catch vulnerabilities before production
- **Performance engineers** who optimize every millisecond
- **Framework specialists** who know Django, Rails, React, and Vue inside out

**The Solution:** This framework transforms Claude Code into a complete development team, with each agent bringing deep, specialized knowledge to your project.

## 💡 See the Difference

```
You: "Build a real-time analytics dashboard"

❌ Without Agent Team:
Claude: *Creates a basic dashboard with generic patterns*

✅ With Agent Team:
├── 🧭 Tech Lead: "Breaking this into specialized tasks for optimal results"
├── 🔍 Code Archaeologist: "Analyzed your codebase - found existing auth system and API patterns"
├── 🏗️ API Architect: "Designing WebSocket endpoints for real-time data streaming"
├── ⚡ Performance Engineer: "Implementing data aggregation and caching strategy"
├── 🎨 React Expert: "Building responsive components with Chart.js and real-time updates"
├── 🛡️ Security Auditor: "Adding rate limiting and authentication to WebSocket connections"
└── ✅ Test Automator: "Created comprehensive test suite with 95% coverage"

Result: Production-ready dashboard with sub-second updates, optimized queries, and enterprise security
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0ldh/claude-code-agents-orchestra.git
cd claude-code-agents-orchestra
```

### 2. Start Building with Your Team

```bash
claude "@agent-tech-lead-orchestrator Build a complete e-commerce checkout system with payment processing"
```

The framework will automatically:

- Analyze your request complexity
- Engage the right specialists
- Coordinate their work
- Deliver production-ready code

## 🔄 How It Works: The Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Intelligent Triage

When you submit a request, the framework:

1. **Analyzes complexity** - Simple task or complex mission?
2. **Identifies requirements** - What expertise is needed?
3. **Engages specialists** - Activates the right team

### Phase 2: Coordinated Execution

The Tech Lead orchestrator:

- **Research Mode**: Specialists gather information in parallel
- **Planning Mode**: Creates detailed technical blueprint
- **Execution Mode**: Agents implement with continuous coordination

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance

Before delivery:

- Code Reviewer validates implementation
- Security Auditor checks vulnerabilities
- Test Automator ensures reliability
- Performance Engineer optimizes bottlenecks

## 👑 Advanced Usage: The Global Rule Book

Transform Claude Code into a strategic development partner with **`CLAUDE.md.example`** - our battle-tested orchestration framework.

### What It Does:

- **Automatic Triage**: Differentiates simple tasks from complex missions
- **Smart Delegation**: Routes requests to the right specialists automatically
- **User Control**: Provides escape hatches for direct interaction

### Set It Up:

```bash
# Copy the framework to activate intelligent orchestration
cp CLAUDE.md.example ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Now Claude Code will automatically manage your agent team
```

### Example in Action:

```
You: "Fix the login bug"
Claude: "This appears to be a simple task. Engaging the debugger..."

You: "Build a real-time chat system"
Claude: "This is a complex mission requiring multiple specialists.
         Engaging the tech-lead-orchestrator to create a plan..."
```
